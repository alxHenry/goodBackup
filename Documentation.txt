 * Description:
	Main loads the DisallowedWords file, begins listening for connections to the server, and 
	then goes into an infinite loop that looks like this:
	
	while (1) {
	Accept(): wait for a connection request 
	echo(): read input from browser, send get request to server, parse for disallowed words, send to browser 
	Close(): close the connection
	
	Echo is where most of the work in our program happens. Echo reads a GET request from the browser,
	parses it, then formats the request we will send to the webserver, sends it, then receives what the
	webserver responds with and outputs it to the browser. It also calls the functions to log and block.
	After echo is finished we are back in the while loop in main where we close the connection with the
	browser and then loop around and begin listening again.
 
 IMPORTANT: In DisallowedWords file, make sure each "word" is on its own line and is followed by a single new line character. So even the last "word" should have a newline after it. Also the file must be in the
 same path and named "DisallowedWords".
